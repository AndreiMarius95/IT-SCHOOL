Create a functional interface named StringProcessor that has a single abstract method process which takes a String parameter and returns a String. Also, create a default method in the interface that allows two StringProcessors to be chained together. Use this to chain together two lambda expressions: one that converts a string to uppercase and another that removes whitespace from a string.
